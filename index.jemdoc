{Announcement}

*I am hiring Ph.D. students to work in machine learning, control, optimization, and game theory with applications in robotic networks, communication networks and systems biology. If you are interested in any of these topics, please send me an [marcosv@vt.edu email].*

{About me}

*Hello!*  Thanks for visiting my research website. I work on team decision problems where multiple agents, often with limited communication, sensing, and computational power, collaborate to perform a given task. One of the main goals in my research has been to design optimal strategies in team decision problems motivated by applications in cyber-physical and biological systems. From 2016 to 2020 I was a postdoc at USC working with [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SUAT64AAAAAJ&hl=en Prof. Urbashi Mitra]. Before that, I did my Ph.D. at the University of Maryland, College Park, where I had the privilege of working with [http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~nmartins/ Prof. Nuno Martins].
